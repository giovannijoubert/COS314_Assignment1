There have been some questions regarding the first assignment.

For the data files, provided via the link in the assignment description, 
the values given in the matrix are the cost of going from row i to column 
j (ie: the value in row 5 column 7 is the cost of going from city 5 to city 7).  

There are two different types of matrices in the data files.  
The first has the diagonal (ie: the distance from a city to itself) 
represented by a very large number (eg: 9999) and the second has the 
diagonal represented by a zero value.  Your program must be able to cater for both types.
Any off-diagonal values of zero should be take to mean that the path cost between those 
two cities is zero.

Your submitted solution must be a single executable file, which takes a string
as a runtime parameter.  This string will be the name of the data file being 
used (you can assume that this string will include any relative directories).
The format of the data file will be as downloaded from the provided URL 
(ie: without adjusting the edge weight matrix to be square).  
The output must be a comma separated list of the path taken and the distance of said path.
The path and its distance should be separated by a hyphen (eg: 1,2,3,1 â€“ 10).

Your executable must be accompanied by a text file which explains, in sufficient detail,
the heuristic that was used.
